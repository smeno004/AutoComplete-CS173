AutoComplete - CS173 (Assignment 5)

Assignment 5 Project for CS173 - Implementing Autocomplete

Current features:
* Building on the nltk brown database
* Currently autocompletes incomplete words
* Simple tkinter interface (to be improved)

Next steps:
* Implement a language model (bigrams/trigrams), to suggest longer phrases
* Improve UI (maybe? If we have time...)
